#### Predicting and Analyzing Rent Prices across the United States

### Project Overview
The rental market has been reshaped by coronavirus over the past few years. With inflation surging, interest rates have sky roketed along with rent. While rental prices all across America are likely to increase over the next coming years, some cities have been impacted more than others. 

We would like to help the average american looking where to rent understand what markets are in his or her price range. We chose 9 different cities - 3 large, 3 midsize, 3 smaller across the US varing in population size based of off the ____.These cities vary from X population to Y population. From those cities we scraped data of home listings from craigslist and pulled values such as price, number of bedrooms, sqft, bathrooms, etc. We will be using a Machine Learning Model ___ to __. 

### Questions We Hope to Answer 
*How accurately can we predict future housing prices with our machine learning model.
*How do the prices compare with the different amenities, bedroom number, sqft, location, etc?
*How does population affect the housing prices?

### Data Collections - ETL
## Extraction
We scraped the data of home listings from craigslist. San Francisco Dataset Source -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/scraping-apartments-off-of-craigslist-in-san-fra

## Transformation
We cleaned the data using pandas. We Counted the number of amenities in each listing, dropped null rows, ensured there were no duplicates, converted the data types, dropped unimportant information, and exported the cleaned data into csv files. 

## Loading
We loaded the data into SQL and combined the various datasets. 

### Machine Learning
